# Tensorflow-embedding-to-convert-text-column-into-numerical
In this project I  have used titanic dataset which I downloaded from Kaggle.
This project focuses on the tensorflow Embeddings API.
This API allows users to extract vector representations, also known as embeddings, from  textual column(family_size,Embarked,sex) of titanic dataset.
I performed some feature engineering and feature extraction method where i removed and created some more column/feature which are used for better model prediction.
In this  project I used tensorflow embedding to convert textual columns(family_size,Embarked,sex) into 3D vector space which is used for model prediction.
Finally, I am using logistic regression and decision tree classifier to predict the model.
